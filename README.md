# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Detection
Create a model which can classify the three major attacking diseases of rice plants like leaf blast, bacterial blight and brown spot.

This project successfully demonstrated the development of a rice leaf disease detection system using CNN models in TensorFlow/Keras. Despite challenges in dataset handling, preprocessing, and training optimization, the model was able to classify leaf images with reasonable accuracy.
